                    Project: Professional Networking & Messaging Web Application

1. Sprint Goal

The primary goal of Sprint 1 was to establish the basic foundation of the Professional Networking & Messaging Web Application.
This sprint focused on setting up the project structure, defining core modules, and implementing initial functionality such as authentication, basic profile system, and overall application architecture.

The objective was not to complete the entire application but to create a functional base that can be enhanced in future sprints using Agile methodology.

2. Project Overview

This web application aims to connect professionals from various fields (developers, designers, doctors, speakers, etc.) with individuals or organizations seeking their services.

The platform combines:

Professional networking

Messaging system

Blogging functionality

Location-based professional discovery

This helps users collaborate, communicate, and share professional content efficiently.

3. Features Covered in Sprint 1

During Sprint 1, the following foundational features were planned and partially implemented:

Authentication System

User registration and login

Role selection (Professional / User / Organization)

Secure authentication setup

Profile System

Basic professional profile creation

Profile information storage

User role management

Initial UI Setup

Landing page structure

Login/Register interface

Dashboard basic layout

4. ER Diagram

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was designed to define the database structure.

Main entities include:

User

Profile

Connection

Message

BlogPost

Comment

Like

The ER diagram helps visualize relationships between users, profiles, messaging, and blogging components.

5. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

A Context Level Data Flow Diagram was created to illustrate system interaction.

It shows:

External entities (Professional, User/Organization)

System boundary (Networking Platform)

Data flow between users and system

This diagram explains how information enters, processes within, and exits the system.

6. Agile Methodology Followed

Sprint-based Agile development approach was used:

Features divided into smaller tasks (user stories)

Incremental development

Modular architecture planning

Continuous improvement approach

7. Tools & Technologies Used

Frontend:

Next.js / React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Backend:

Node.js / Express API

JWT Authentication

Database:

PostgreSQL / MongoDB (planned)

Other Tools:

GitHub for version control

AI-assisted development tools for rapid prototyping

8. Challenges Faced

Understanding system architecture planning

Database schema design

Integrating multiple modules together

Managing collaboration workflow using GitHub

These challenges provided valuable practical learning experience.

9. Future Scope (Next Sprints)

Upcoming sprints will focus on:

Real-time messaging system

Professional search by location and skills

Blogging platform completion

Connection request system

Notifications and UI improvements

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1 successfully established the foundation of the Professional Networking & Messaging Web Application.
The core architecture, initial authentication, and design planning have been completed, enabling further development in upcoming sprints.

This sprint provided practical exposure to Agile development, system design, and full-stack project workflow.
